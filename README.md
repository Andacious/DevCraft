A rich wrapper around the vanilla Minecraft server.

This project was started ~3 years ago to solve some of the shortcomings of the out-of-the-box Minecraft server. The first capability I added was scheduled backups. First simple "after x hours" backups, then daily/weekly/monthly backups. I also then added the ability to compress backups and to delete them after so many days. It runs the Minecraft jar using the System.Diagnostics.Process library build in to the .NET framework. It allows for input and output from the server. At this point it is very simple, and I figured that backups would be built in to Minecraft by now, but they arent. So I have decided to ressurrect this project and host it on GitHub. I love vanilla Minecraft more than any modded version.
